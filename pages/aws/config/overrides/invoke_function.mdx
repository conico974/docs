This override is used by OpenNext to invoke the function for warmup purposes. It is only used in the warmer server.

If you want to better understand how to implement your own InvokeFunction, the easiest way would be to take a look at the existing included InvokeFunction [here](https://github.com/opennextjs/opennextjs-aws/tree/main/packages/open-next/src/overrides/warmer).

You could override this to provide some custom logic to invoke more or less function depending on the hour for example.
