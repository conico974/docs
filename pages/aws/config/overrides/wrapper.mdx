This is the main entrypoint of the server. It is used for every server and allow you to run either in serverless mode or as a long running server.

If you want to better understand how to implement your own Wrapper, the easiest way would be to take a look at one of the existing [included Wrapper](https://github.com/opennextjs/opennextjs-aws/tree/main/packages/open-next/src/overrides/wrappers).

Couple of things to note :
- If you want to use streaming (for the `node` runtime of next), you'll need to create a `StreamCreator` and pass it to the `handler`. You can find some example in the [node](https://github.com/opennextjs/opennextjs-aws/blob/main/packages/open-next/src/overrides/wrappers/node.ts) or [aws-lambda-streaming](https://github.com/opennextjs/opennextjs-aws/blob/main/packages/open-next/src/overrides/wrappers/aws-lambda-streaming.ts) wrapper.
- If you don't use streaming (like in the default `aws-lambda` wrapper), you may still need to provide a fake `StreamCreator` to the `handler` to avoid a weird issue with Node itself (see [here](https://github.com/opennextjs/opennextjs-aws/blob/f685ddea8f8a5c82591dc02713aff7138f2d9896/packages/open-next/src/overrides/wrappers/aws-lambda.ts#L49-L65) for an example and a more thorough explanation).
- If you use the `edge` runtime of Next (either for the external middleware or for an `edge` route or page), you don't need the `StreamCreator` at all.
- If you are in a serverless environment and it supports `waitUntil`, you should define it here(see [here](https://github.com/opennextjs/opennextjs-aws/blob/f685ddea8f8a5c82591dc02713aff7138f2d9896/packages/open-next/src/overrides/wrappers/cloudflare.ts#L29)). This might not be necessary depending on where you run it (for example the `aws-lambda-streaming` or the `node` wrapper doesn't need it.)
